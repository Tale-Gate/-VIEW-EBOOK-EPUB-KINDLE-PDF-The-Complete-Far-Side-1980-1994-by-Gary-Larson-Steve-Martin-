"Every one of these cartoons is just something that drifted into my head when I was alone with my thoughts. And, for better or worse, I 'jotted' them down. It was only later, when perhaps I received an angry letter from someone, that it struck me: Hey! Someone's been reading my diary!" --Gary Larson, from the preface to The Complete Far Side
Revered by its fans as the funniest, most original, most "What the ... ?"-inspiring cartoon ever, The Far Side debuted in Januar

Title: Cartoons are too small
Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2019
Review: I love the Far Side, the cartoons are great, some of the best literary work of the last 50 years. However, this collection makes me furious because somebody decided to be cute with the formatting and leave mostly blank pages. When I first got it my thought was, "Are you kidding me?" Because every cartoon can be about 25% larger. I'm 43 now and thanks to this collection I'm starting to realize I need glasses. Any cartoon that has hand scrawled print in the frame is nearly impossible to read. But lo and behold, there's plenty of blank white space surrounding each cartoon! What the heck man! Slap the designer upside the head, I didn't pay for a book of empty blank space. Come out with a new collection please!

Title: I love Larson and owed it to him to buy this, but I suspect the paperback version will get my 5-stars.
Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2016
Review: This review is for the HARDCOVER version of The Complete Far Side.

I am such a fan of Gary Larson. I can honestly say that The Far Side has made my life better, and I'm a firm believer that people should be paid for entertainment, and art... which is why I bought this, even though I've bought all the other books, in paperback... over the years. If you're reading this, I'm not telling you anything you don't know about the brilliance that is, The Far Side.

Well... so why 4 stars? Why not 5? I'm going to offer some honest opinions that I think will help you decide between this version, The Complete Far Side IN HARDCOVER vs the very same, in paperback.

No need to draw out this review, but depending on who you are buying this for... the WEIGHT is a factor. Wow... 20lbs! Each volume of course, is just under 10lbs. These are books that you set on a table to read... or leave open on a coffee table, or somewhere that a person can leaf through a couple pages briefly. I had no idea they would be so... big! Big is good, but inside, the individual comics have a lot of space around them. These books could have been 3" shorter while keeping the comics the same size... I'd have been thrilled (full 5-stars) if the comics were enlarged to fill more of each page. When I pick up the book I can't help wondering why I'm lifting 3-4lbs of blank paper. At the spine of the book, I can appreciate a good margin so the comics aren't draining in, but beyond that, I appreciate a bigger picture (or less book).

My old paperbacks that I've bought through the years, as they were released, have sentimental value for me... as they made for a nice break in high-school, but they are starting to smell like old books... and hopefully some charity will appreciate them, so I guess I'll ALSO be buying the paperback "complete" version... just for a more user-friendly experience. (and "fresh" comics to re-read)

I think The Complete Far Side might very well be the thing that would make me buy a Kindle or similar, if it were available in that format. I bought this from seeing TFS posted online... and realizing that, again, Gary should be paid for his work rather than have it "shared" for free... however, that's also why the publishers should make a paid version to enjoy TFS on a tablet.

Title: Outstanding Quality - Hardcover Version
Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2019
Review: The quality of this hardcover set is amazing! I read the reviews of how heavy this is, but you don't realize just how heavy until you try to hold it on your lap. You need a pillow or lap desk to hold it's weight. This set is for people who truly appreciate quality, and the quality of this far exceeds the cost. Of course The Far Side itself needs no explanation; it's brilliant.

Title: Fantastic set of Larson's drawings!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2018
Review: I received this from my Wife & Daughter for Christmas, fantastic gift and greatly appreciated! I've always been a fan of Larson's work, just too funny!

This is a heavy set of books but it is the complete works so go figure. Once I make my way through the whole collection I will repeat the process, probably many times!

I've already seen quite a number of his drawings that I never saw before, great stuff.

Title: A Must-Have For Larson Fans
Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2017
Review: If you're a Gary Larson fan, this is a must-have collection of all of his work. The hard cover edition is beautiful, but it weighs a ton. Definitely solely a coffee table item or for keeping as a collector's item. The paperback edition is no lightweight either, but it can be held and read without too much effort. Not as "glorious" as the hard cover, but it's beautiful in its own right and, most importantly, also contains all of Larson's work, many in color, most in b&w, as originally printed back in the day.

If you love The Far Side, this is for you. Makes a great gift for Larson fans. Either edition is worth owning, they're both put together well and will provide years of enjoyment and laughter.

I LOVE The Far Side and was so happy when I stumbled across this. I just HAD to have it. When the hard cover proved to be too much to read while relaxing in my favorite chair, I went ahead and bought the paperback, too. I can't think of any other work for which I'd spring for two editions. I like Gary Larson that much :)

Title: Hours and hours of side-splitting laughter awaits you!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2017
Review: Can't go wrong with Far Side cartoons. My only wish is that the cartoons would have been bigger on the pages, as in when they published the single books. It is funny to read the letters that are inserted within the pages of each book, as Gary Larson or the papers that carried his cartoons received many letters. It really does make you realize that truth is stranger than fiction when you read these letters from very upset people who are either offended, don't get the joke he was trying to make, or in one case the writer of the letter wanted him to withdraw the cartoon because it undermined the evolutionist's theory of how life evolved! His mother got a phone call from a reporter over a cartoon that no one seemed to understand and so they thought if anyone knew what Gary was trying to say, mom would know. Sadly, mom didn't get the joke either so Gary had to give a big explanation as to what was going through his mind when he drew it. Can't make this stuff up! This is a great present (I got it for my birthday). I'm having to purposely only allow myself so many pages of amusement at a time as I could sit there for hours, having a good laugh.
